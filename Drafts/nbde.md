## NBDE

Network Bound Disk Encryption is a Method to handle automatically LUKS

## Motivation

for baremetal system in location such as datacenters. It should protected
against access data to data on storage media in case of lost or vendor lifecycle management.

## Proposal

NBDE should be an optional security feature for the SouvereignCloudStack's infrastructure,
to handle certification like C5

## Technical requirements and features

the involved components:

- clevis - is a JOSE'based pluggable framework which is handled automated luks encryption local
    inside the boot procedure an is able to handle network base encryption or combine it
    other methods.

                https://github.com/latchset/clevis

- tang - is a small webserver with the Jose library, which is able response to clevis prepared
    encryption.chain and save it as a key answer it with a advertisement request, Tang
    relies on the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) standards

                https://github.com/latchset/tang

- Jose - is the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption Framework, in NBDE context it.
    use an rsa based. Encryption.
