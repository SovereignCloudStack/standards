# Objective

The objective of this document is to establish a common understanding of the monitoring architecture of the SCS stack. This document refers to various roles. These are defined in the [overall role definitions](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Design-Docs/blob/master/terms_and_roles_identity_and_access_management.md).

# Definitions

The term _monitoring_ is used to describe methods that enable **Anomaly Detection**, provide
**Operational Visibility** and allow **Capacity Planning**.

Furthermore it is being distinguished between _whitebox monitoring_ and _blackbox monitoring_.


Intent                  | Whitebox Monitoring | Blackbox Monitoring
------------------------|---------------------|--------------------
Capacity Planning       | x                   | -
Anomaly Detection       | x                   | x
Operational Visibility  | x                   | x


The term **monitoring** includes:

* Healthcheck data (state)
* Telemetry (metrics)
* Centralized Log aggregation


# Roles

There are various roles within the SCS scope that interact from different viewpoints with the monitoring (data). While the _operator_ needs to be able to have a full stack view, the _supporter_ looks from a slightly different viewpoint upon the monitoring. 


Role                    | Capacity Planning | Anomaly Detection | Operational Visibility
------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------
Operator (Provider)     | x                 | x                 | x
Supporter (Provider)    | -                 |(x)                | x
Integrator              | (x)               | x                 |(x)
Developer               | -                 | x                 | -


Aside from these roles there are further cases that will use data aggregated as part of the monitoring:

* Provider Invoicing will need telemetry on usage data in order to provide billing.
* The SCS vendor will need anonymized usage data on the overall SCS stack adoption.


# Alerting

Wether the source are logs, metrics or health checks alerts need to be aggregated and transported via the _alert routing_ to the provider-specific alerting engine. This allows the flexibility of each Provider coming with their specific alerting engine while keeping the alert routing within the SCS stack standardised.

# Architecture 

Monitoring happens on two layers: _infrastructure layer_ and the _container layer_. This is illustrated in [the overview diagram](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Design-Docs/blob/wip-overview-monitoring-architecture/overview_monitoring_architecture.svg).
Each layer has their own set of components to assure independence.
