# Procuring Open Source Projects

OSS project health check

## Four Opens

- Code is fully open source (OSI license)
  - Open Core is not an option
  - License handling clear
  - dealing with non-licensing IPR questions (patents, trademarks, ...)
- Community is open and diverse

  - Distributed over countries, companies, ....

- Development process is open

  - Documented contribution process (how to get started, how to contribute,
    expected behaviors/CoC, standards, ...)
  - Project trying to invite/encourage contributors
  - Discussions happen in the open (easily accessible)

- Design process is open
  - Process for proposals/blueprints
  - Decision process is clear, accessbile, traceable
  - Requirements are gathered, recorded, prioritized
  - Roadmaps / Goals

## Maturity

- Quality
  - Regressions
- Maintenance policies
- Handling security issues
- Tracking & addressing bugs
- Development process maturity (code review, policies)
- CI processes, CI coverage, CI status monitoring
- Implementation of relevant standards
  - Ideally with compliance tests
- Defines own standards that can be implemented independently
  - With compliance tests

## Security

- Supply-chain transparency / SBOM
- Security contacts, security response
- Secure coding practices
- Review
- Security-related test cases in CI

## Activity

- Active development (and maintenance)
  - Attracting new users & contributors
  - Able to retain contributors
  - Number of Forks, number of contributors
- Adoption
  - Others building on top
  - Products using it
  - Companies offering services ... around it
- Visibility
  - Press
  - Conferences
- Community events, ambassadors
- Collaboration with other communities / projects

## Lock-in risk assessment

- Risk of project failure
  - Single Points of Failure (too few maintainers / core contributors / core reviewers?)
  - Conflicting commercial interests of main contributors?
- Effect of failure (damage):
  - How easily could it be forked and taken over?
  - How easily could it be ripped out and replaced?
