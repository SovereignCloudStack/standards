# Sovereign Cloud Stack â€“ Standards and Certification

SCS unifies the best of cloud computing in a certified standard. With a decentralized and federated cloud stack, SCS puts users in control of their data and fosters trust in clouds, backed by a global open-source community.

## SCS compatible clouds

See [Compliant clouds overview](https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview) on our docs page.

## SCS standards overview

Standards are organized as certification levels according to [SCS-0003-v1](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0003-v1-sovereign-cloud-standards-yaml.md). We currently maintain one certification level `scs-compatible` that is described here: [Tests/scs-compatible-iaas.yaml](Tests/scs-compatible-iaas.yaml).

More certification levels will follow as the project progresses.
