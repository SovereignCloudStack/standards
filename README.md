# SCS documentation

[Here](GettingStarted.MD) you find documention how to use SCS as a developer / user.

If you are looking how to get started with setting up your own SCS infrastructure,
please look [here](https://docs.osism.de/) at the OSISM docs for a physical deployment or
[here](https://docs.osism.de/testbed/) for a virtual deployment of SCS (Infra, ceph, 
OpenStack, monitorig, containers, ...) on OpenStack. The iX article (see
our [homepage](https://scs.community/) is worth reading as well.
