# Objective

The objective of this document is to define a basic set of roles and their identifiers / names in SCS. These roles can be used in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) of SCS itself and / or in services provided based on SCS. As Roles are often derived from Usecases which are derived from terms used in a project, the document starts with a definition of terms used in SCS and/or GAIA-X. These definitions should be moved into a separate document in the future.

## Principles used to create this document

Where possible the roles and names are derived from existing definitions or conventions used in the underlying software. As SCS is part of GAIA-X, the terms/definitions of GAIA-X are taken as a baseline and will be extended with additional roles needed in SCS. For reference, the current state of relevant GAIA-X definitions can be found at the end of this document.

## SCS terms and their definition

These terms were defined taking into account the GAIA-X definitions to ensure that the same terms are shared.

term               | definition
-------------------|---------------
Provider           | Legal entity providing SCS to customers. The Provider is typically in control of physical infrastructure (Datacenter, Hosts, Storage, Network etc.) but also employs people who deploy and operate SCS.
Consumer           | Legal entity which can access and/or consume services hosted on SCS. Typically a Consumer is a customer of a Provider.
End User           | Person which accesses Services running on SCS. Typically a person knows about the Consumer entity and the services but not about SCS or the Provider. An End User might be an employee or customer of the Consumer.
Identity           | An Idenity is a technical unique representation of an entity (a Person, a legal entity like a Consumer, or an technical entity like a Service). An Identity might need to be trustworthy, so the technical representation has to include a trust relationship.
Identity System   | A technical solution that does authentication for Identities (i.e. checking a username, password and 2nd factor) and provides additional attributes to the identity.
Module             | Technical solution / Software which is part of a SCS deployment.
Access Rights      | Represent different capabilities an Identity might have while interacting with a Module. For example read or write access to a file system or access to functionality of an API.
Role               | A role is a set of Rights for Modules of SCS. Authorization to access modules is done by checking whether the accessing Identity owns a Role that has the needed Access Rights assigned. Roles can be assigned to groups of identities or directly to identities.
Host               | A Host is a physical machine which is part of a Node. A Node consists of several Hosts.
Node               | A Node is a deployment of SCS which offers Services for Customers and/or Endusers. A Node typically is a group of physical Hosts.
Operator           | Person operating parts of SCS. Each Person is represented by an Identity. Access rights needed to operate are given by assigning an Identity to a Role.

## SCS modules / components

A module or component of SCS typically is a software stack deployed with a dedicated usecase. This list needs to be elaborated over time.

**this is a best guess example and needs review**

module                 | description
-----------------------|--------------------------
OpenStack_```<submodule>```  | TBD
Kubernetes_```<submodule>``` | TBD
*to be continued*      |

## SCS Roles

Set of Roles which are initially part of SCS.

```xml
A Role should be defined as "<Module>_<Usecase>", where "<Module>" is the main module this role applies to and "<Usecase>" a short term to give context which kind of rights / options are given to an identity as member of this role.
```

**this is a best guess example and needs review**

Role                  | Description
----------------------|--------------------------
host_deployment       | Access to a Host by an identity used in automated deployment and maintenance. Typicall Identities used by Ansible to access Hosts.
host_operator         | Full Access to a Host. Typically there is one Host Operator Role for each physical Host, so the Role can be given temporary to a Person in case of an incident and removed afterwards.
OpenStack_Deployment  | TBD
OpenStack_Operator    | TBD
OpenStack_Customer    | TBD
Kubernetes_Deployment | TBD
Kubernetes_Operator   | TBD
Kubernetes_Customer   | TBD
*to be continued*      |

## Current definitions of GAIA-X

This is an excerpt if terms defined in the GAIA-X project. The definitions are work in progress and might change, so this document might be outdated.
