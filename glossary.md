Standard: 
A standard in SCS is a definition of how a certain cloud computing stack is to be configured or operated or functioning in order to be SCS compliant. Each standard is described in an architectural decision record (ADR). 

Layer: 
An SCS standard refer to either one of two different Layers - Iaas (Infrastructur as a Service) or KaaS (Kubernetes as a Service), which are independent of each other. 

Certification bundle (pool): 
Several single standards for a certain layer build a certification bundle. In order to award an SCS certification for a certain Layer ALL standards in the certification bundle must be verifiably implemented in the target cloud environment. 

Version:
Certification bundles are issued in versions with certain version numbers. Each version is valid in a certain time period, i.e. has a start date and an expiry date. Between two version there should be a grace period, in which either version of a certification bundle may be implemented to award an SCS certificate. 

SCS Compliant: 
A cloud computing environment is SCS compliant, when it has implemented all standards of a certification bundle of the current valid version and this is verified by an independent certification assessment body.

Level : 
The final stage of SCS certification will consist of three different levels:
SCS compatible 
SCS open 
SCS Sovereign
These levels define different grades of sovereignity and are certified in different ways.
