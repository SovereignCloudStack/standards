# Standards Directory

This directory contains SCS Standards and SCS (Architecure) Decision Records.
Some of the Standards and ADRs may be in Draft state or Obsolete, which is
no reason to delete them.
While we strive to (and want providers to) comply to all stabilized Standards,
only the ones listed in Tests/scs-compatible.yaml are required for SCS
certification.
