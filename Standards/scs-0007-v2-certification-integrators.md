## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to describe a concept for how an implementation partner can obtain certification as SCS Integrator. In essence, this certificate is intended to express that an organization has sufficient technical knowledge and experience to provide technical support to companies using SCS.
This certification is demanding by design, and it may take some time for a company aspiring to become an SCS integrator to reach the requirements. For this scenario, a lesser variant of the certificate, called SCS Incubator, is also defined.

## Motivation

As an implementation partner, I want to obtain a certificate as _Certified SCS IaaS Integrator_ or _Certified SCS KaaS Integrator_ in order to prove sufficient technical knowledge and experience to provide technical support for SCS.

## Regulations

The certificates are awarded for the period of one year.
The certification is done either by the Forum SCS-Standards or an attestation body nominated by the forum.

### Certificates

- Certified SCS IaaS Integrator: SCS IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) implementation partner
- Certified SCS KaaS Integrator: SCS KaaS (Kubernetes as a Service) implementation partner
- Certified SCS IaaS Incubator: aspiring SCS IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) implementation partner
- Certified SCS KaaS Incubator: aspiring SCS KaaS (Kubernetes as a Service) implementation partner

### Criteria

<!-- Criteria for certification, proof of experience in setting up, operating and supporting SCS-compliant environments. -->

SCS is an open source community project with the goal of enabling digital sovereignty. As such, the commitment and support of this mission SHOULD be recognized and promoted beyond technical competence.

The implementation partner SHOULD work towards ensuring that digital sovereignty is implemented in accordance with the SCS definition (Standards and [Mission Statement](https://docs.scs.community/community/mission-statement)). This is expressed in a way that, in addition to the technology used to build environments (not necessarily only SCS environments), knowledge and experience in SCS standards compliance (SCS-compatible IaaS and KaaS) is also available and that environments built by this implementation partner have already been configured in accordance with the standards and are listed on the SCS compliance list.

The implementation partner SHOULD work towards ensuring that the cloud environments it sets up and/or manages are also officially visible as SCS clouds, thereby strengthening the SCS brand.

The implementation partner MUST achieve at least FOUR points (for Integrator) or TWO points (for Incubator) according to the following system:

- two points for each SCS-compliant environment of a third party successfully brought into production in the last 12 months;
- two points for each SCS-compliant environment of a third party actively being managed by the applicant for the last 12 months, one point for 6 months;
- two points for each SCS-compliant public-cloud environment with at least two regions or at least three availability zones being operated by the applicant for the last 12 months, one point for 6 months.

Here, an SCS-compliant environment is one that qualifies for [_Certified SCS-compatible IaaS_](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-iaas) or [_Certified SCS-compatible KaaS_](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-compatible-kaas), depending on the desired certification.

### Attestation

The audit for the certification of an implementation partner is carried out by a person appointed by the Forum SCS-Standards. The person will assess and, if necessary, obtain evidence from the implementation partner to be certified as to whether and to what extent the criteria have been met.
