## Introduction

Volume Types are used to classify volumes and provide a basic decision for what kind of volume should be created. These volume types can sometimes be very backend-specific and it might be hard for a user to choose the most suitable volume type, if there is more than one default type.

### Glossary

The following special terms are used throughout this standard document:
| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| volume | OpenStack ressource, virtual drive which usually resides in a network storage backend |
| AZ | Availability Zone |
| Volume QoS | Quality of Service object for Volumes |

## Motivation

While a user can choose simple things like size when creating a volume, Volume Types define a few broader aspects of a volume. Encryption of volumes for example is solely decided by the volume type. While the option with which the volume will be replicated is a mix between definition in the volume type and backend specific configuration, but it's visibility can only be reached in the volume type. In the following part, we want to state, which varieties of volume types are REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED within an SCS-compatible deployment.

## Design Considerations

All Considerations can be looked up in detail in the [Decision Record for the Volume Type Standard.](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0111-v1-volume-type-decisions.md)

To test whether a deployment has volume types with certain aspects, the discoverability of the parameters in the volume type has to be given. The following table shows, which aspects are considered in this standard. Furthermore the table shows, according to the current upstream implementation, whether the feature is discoverable, and who can discover this. The comments state what can be done to help with the discoverability and other important restrictions. The last column says how the standard is handled, which is currently through the addition of a standardized phrase at the beginning of the description of a volume type.

| Aspect | Part of Standard | Discoverability | comments | concluded standardized description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| encryption | **Recommended** | admin only | Upstream work for extra_spec: encrypted=True/False needed | **"[encrypted]"** |
| Replication | **Recommended** | backend-dependend | Upstream: setable extra_spec would help | **"[replicated]"** |
| AZs | **Optional** | - | Upstream: setable extra_spec would help | - |
| multiattach | **Optional** | yes | - | - |
| Number of Replicas, etc | **Optional** | backend-dependend | Upstream: setable extra_spec would help | - |
| Volume QoS | **Optional** | admin only | depends on the admin only volume qos object | - |
| Backend name | no | - | - | - |

In addition it is possible to use multiple of those aspects within one volume type. SCS will only ever look, if there is a volume type that has an aspect, but they don't have to be different volume types.
Example: one volume type that uses LUKS-encryption with a ceph storage with inherent replication would fulfill all recommendations of this standard.

The current downside is that users without admin rights currently cannot see the recommended aspects. We want and need to change this in the OpenStack workflow through adding discoverable properties (e.g. "encrypted"="true" and "replicated"="true") that are also visible for users. This way we will be able to automatically check whether a volume type with encyrption and or replication is present. It should look like this example for encryption:

| description        | None                                                                                                                                                         |

| qos_specs_id       | None                                                                                                                                                         |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

We want to find a way to also use the internal extra_spec for replication, when the replication is automatically done by the backend. If this is not possible, we would like to introduce another property, which has to be set by the admin, when setting the volume type. Only after that we will have the possibility to automatically check for a volume type with replication.

## DEFAULT volume types

There is always a default volume type defined in an OpenStack deployment. The SCS does not have any requirements about this volume type at this moment, instead deployers are free to choose what fits best in their environment. Conversely, a cloud user can not expect any specific behavior or properties from default volume types.

The parameters of volume types described in this standard do not have to be applied to the chosen default volume type. And the SCS will not make any assumptions about parameters being present in the default volume type.

## REQUIRED volume types

Currently the SCS will not require volume types with certain specification. This will change in the future.

## RECOMMENDED volume types

The SCS recommends to have one or more volume types, that satisfy the need for encrpytion and replication. These are all allowed possibilites for those recommended volume types:

| Volume Type Nr | Type Name | Volume Type Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | `__DEFAULT__` | `[encrypted][replicated] Volumes will be encrypted and three times replicated` |
| 2 | `LUKS` | `[encrypted] This volume type creates LUKS encryped volumes` |
| 3 | `replicated` | `[replicated] Volumes will be three times replicated` |

The standardized phrases are `[encrypted]` and `[replicated]`. They MUST appear at the beginning of the description of the volume type and they MUST be ordered alphabetically. Having only volume type number 1 would be enough to fulfill all recommendations. Having only volume types 2 and 3 together would also satisfy all recommendations

### Encryption

Encryption for volumes is an option which has to be configured within the volume type. As an admin it is possible to set encryption-provider, key size, cipher and control location. And for admins it is also currently possible to see these configurations in a volume type with both list and show commands.

```text
openstack volume type list --encryption-type
+--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name        | Is Public | Encryption                                                                                                                                                                         |
+--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| d34b5de0-d7bf-43cf-8a74-3827169d6616 | LUKS        | True      | cipher='aes-xts-plain64', control_location='front-end', encryption_id='217386bc-1e9b-46a3-9e0e-3ad62c07826c', key_size='256', provider='nova.volume.encryptors.luks.LuksEncryptor' |
+--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

As this is not visible for users, it will be necessary that deployers state that the volume type is encrypted in the description of the volume type in the following way:
The description needs to begin with `[encrypted]`, after that any further description is allowed. It should look like this example:

```text
openstack volume type show LUKS
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field              | Value                                                                                                                                                        |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| access_project_ids | None                                                                                                                                                         |
| description        | [encrypted] This volume uses LUKS-encryption                                                                                                                 |
| id                 | d63307fb-167a-4aa0-9066-66595ea9fb21                                                                                                                         |
| is_public          | True                                                                                                                                                         |
| name               | LUKS                                                                                                                                                         |
| qos_specs_id       | None                                                                                                                                                         |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Replication

Replication states, whether or not there are multiple replicas of a volume. Thus answers the question, whether the data could survive a node outage. Unfortunately there are two ways replication can be achieved:

1. In the configuration of a volume type. It then is visible as extra_spec in the properties of a volume type.
2. Via the used backend. Ceph for example provides automatic replication, that does not need to be specified in the volume type. This is currently not visible for users.

To fulfill this recommentation for now, the deployer needs to state the replication in the description of a volume type in the following way:
If the volume type is not encrypted the description needs to begin with `[replicated]`, after that any further description is allowed.
Otherwise the description needs to begin with `[encrypted][replicated]`.

### Example

One volume type that is configured as an encrypted volume type in a ceph backend, with automated replication would fit both recommendations and will be enough to comply to this part of the volume type standard.

It should look like the following part:

```text

## Conformance Tests

As there are currently no REQUIRED volume types, we can only look for the RECOMMENDED aspects and thus executing a conformance test is not a must.
Furthermore the recommended aspects currently have to be described in the description by the deployer. In future versions we aim to integrate some extra_specs for them in upstream OpenStack
And it is also possible that a single volume type can currently fulfill all RECOMMENDED aspects.

The current test will check for the presence of `[encrypted]` and `[replicated]` in the description of at least one volume type.
