## Introduction

### Entropy in information technology

Entropy is a concept that is widely used in the scope of information
technology. It is a measurement of the amount of disorder or randomness in
a system. Entropy is used to measure the amount of information in a
self-contained system, as well as the amount of incertitude that exists in this
system.

### Real-world uses of entropy

Cryptography is a very prominent, albeit not the only application that
heavily relies on entropy for operations such as creating secure keys.
When the available _entropy runs out_, said operations can stall and
take an abnormally long amount of time, which in turn can lead to
malfunctions, e.g., with OpenSSL or load balancers.

### Sources of entropy

In _traditional baremetal systems_ the amount of incertitude is sourced
from the randomness of the read/write cycles of the disk heads of a disk drive,
bus timings, or keyboard timings, to name a few.

_More recent methods_ of generating entropy include measuring IRQ jitter
(available in Linux since kernel 5.4 or, before that, via a daemon such as
[HavegeD](http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/)) as well as dedicated CPU
instructions (available in virtually all major CPUs: RDSEED or RDRAND
on x86_64 and RNDR on arm64).

Finally, a dedicated device can be utilized — if present — that is
called _hardware random number generator_ or HRNG for short. For instance,
the [Trusted Platform Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module)
includes a HRNG. On Linux systems, the HRNG appears as `/dev/hwrng`.
Note that, while the dedicated CPU instructions can be construed as
a HRNG, they are not treated as such by the kernel, i.e., they _do not_
appear as `/dev/hwrng`!

The Linux kernel combines multiple sources of entropy into a pool. To this
end, it will use all of the sources discussed so far with one exception:
the HRNG must be fed into the pool (if so desired) via the daemon `rngd`.
The kernel converts the entropy from the pool into cryptographically
secure random numbers that appear under `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom`.

With kernel 5.18, the algorithm that accomplishes
said conversion has been drastically improved (see
[linux-rng-5.17-18](https://web.archive.org/web/20230321040526/https://www.zx2c4.com/projects/linux-rng-5.17-5.18/)),
so much so that running out of entropy is virtually ruled out.
These patches have now also arrived in the upstream LTS images.

### Entropy in virtual instances

Virtual instances or virtual machines do not have the traditional sources
of entropy mentioned above. However, the more recent methods mentioned
above do work just fine (the CPU instructions are not privileged).

Alternatively, a virtualized HRNG called `virtio-rng` can be established
that injects entropy from the host into the instance, where this
entropy can be sourced optionally from either the host's `/dev/random` or
some HRNG in the host. This virtualized HRNG behaves just like a real
one, that is, it appears as `/dev/hwrng`, and the daemon `rngd` must
be used to feed it into the kernel's entropy pool.

On a side note, the kernel exposes available HRNGs via the special
directory `/sys/devices/virtual/misc/hw_random`. In particular, the
file `rng_available` lists availabe HRNGs while the file `rng_current`
contains the HRNG currently used.

In summary, with current kernels and CPUs entropy in virtual instances
is readily available to a sufficient degree. In addition, the host's
entropy sources can be injected using `virtio-rng` if so desired, e.g.,
to enable access to a HRNG.

## Motivation

As stated above, good sources of entropy are paramount for many
important applications. This standard ensures that sufficient entropy
will be available in virtual instances.

## Entropy in SCS clouds

### Flavors

It is recommended that all flavors have the following attribute:

```console
hw_rng:allowed=True
```

The following attributes are optional:

```console
hw_rng:rate_bytes - The allowed amount of bytes for the the guest
    to read from the host's entropy per period.
hw_rng:rate_period - Sets the duration of a read period in seconds.
```

### Images

It is recommended to use images having a kernel (patch level) version 5.18
or up. This condition is already satisfied by every mandatory image defined
in the [Image Metadata Standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Standards/scs-0102-v1-image-metadata.md).

It is recommended that images activate the attribute `hw_rng_model: virtio`.

The daemon `rngd` must be installed (usually from `rng-tools`
or `rng-utils`).

The user may choose to use the `virtio-rng` device via `rngd`.

### Compute nodes

Compute nodes must use CPUs that offer instructions for accessing
entropy (such as RDSEED or RDRAND on x86_64 or RNDR on arm64), and
these instructions may not be filtered by the hypervisor.
If this requirement cannot be verified directly, then at least the
following two conditions must be satisfied in a virtual instance:

1. The special file `/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail` must contain
the value 256 (pinned since kernel 5.18).

2. The number of FIPS 140-2 failures must not exceed 3 out of 1000 blocks
tested, as determined by `cat /dev/random | rngtest -c 1000` .

Compute nodes may provide a HRNG via `rngd`.
