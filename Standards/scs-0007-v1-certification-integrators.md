   SCS-0007 defines the process and rules on how SCS certified integrators are certified.

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to describe a concept for how implementation partners can obtain SCS certification. In essence, this certificate is intended to express that an organization has sufficient technical knowledge and experience to provide technical support to companies using SCS. 
For this purpose, two essential criteria are defined that must be fulfilled. In addition, there are a few other criteria that can be taken into account in favor of certification.

## Motivation

## Regulations

The certificates are awarded for the period for one year.
The certification is done either by the Forum SCS-Standards or a attestation body nominated by the Forum SCS-Standards.

### Certificates

_SCKI_ → SCS Certified Kubernetes Integrator: SCS KaaS (Kubernetes as a Service) implementation partner
_SCII_ → SCS Certified Infrastrucure Integrator: SCS IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) implementation partner

Criteria for certification, proof of experience in setting up, operating and supporting SCS-compliant environments.

The organization to be certified must be verifiable

- have successfully brought at least two SCS-compliant environments of a third party (customer) into production in the last 12 months 

or 

- actively manage at least two such environments of third parties (customers) at the time the certificate is issued 

or 

- have been operating an SCS-compliant public cloud with at least two regions or at least three availability zones for more than one year.

### Additional favorable criteria for certification

SCS is an open source community project with the goal of enabling digital sovereignty. As such, the commitment and support of this mission should be recognized and promoted beyond technical competence. To this end, the following aspects can be taken into account for certification or compensate for any criteria that are not fully met (see above):

"The implementation partners should work towards ensuring that digital sovereignty is implemented in accordance with the SCS definition (Standards, Open Software, OpenOperations). This is expressed in such a way that, in addition to the technology used to build environments (not necessarily only SCS environments), knowledge and experience in SCS standards compliance (SCS-compatible IaaS and KaaS) is also available and that environments built by this organization have already been configured in accordance with the standards and are listed on the SCS compliance list."

"The implementation partners should work towards ensuring that the cloud environments they set up and/or manage are also officially visible as SCS clouds, thereby strengthening the SCS brand."

### Attestation

The audit for the certification of an implementation partner is carried out by a person appointed by the SCS Standards Forum. The person will assess and, if necessary, obtain evidence from the organization to be certified as to whether and to what extent the criteria have been met. 

If the above criteria are not 100% fulfilled, the certificate can still be issued if 
    • the company to be certified obtains proof of knowledge through a suitability loan for at least one joint project with an already certified company; the projects must be notified to the Forum in advance and approved by the Forum in advance. 
    • The company is particularly qualified for this for other reasons. The forum decides on this by simple majority.
  
If one of the above criteria is not met, the forum must decide by simple majority whether the certification may be maintained.
