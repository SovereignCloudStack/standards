## Introduction

This is the standard v2.0 for SCS Release 4.
Note that we intend to only extend it (so it's always backwards compatible),
but try to avoid changing in incompatible ways.
(See at the end for the v1 to v2 transition where we have not met that
goal, but at least managed to have a 1:1 relationship between v1 and v2 names.)

## Motivation

In OpenStack environments there is a need to define different flavors for instances.
The flavors are pre-defined by the operator, the customer can not change these.
OpenStack providers thus typically offer a large selection of flavors.

While flavors can be discovered (`openstack flavor list`), it is helpful for users (DevOps teams),
to have

- A naming scheme that is used across all SCS flavors, so flavor names have the same meaning everywhere.
- Have a guaranteed set of flavors available on all SCS clouds, so these do not need to be discovered.

While not all details will be encoded in the name, the key features should be obvious:
Number of vCPUs, RAM, Root Disk.
Extra features are important as well: There will be flavors with GPU support, fast disks for databases,
memory-heavy applications, and other useful aspects of an instance.

It may also be important to make the CPU generation clearly recognizable, as this is always a topic in
discussions with customers.

Note that not all relevant properties of flavors can be discovered; creating a specification
to address this is a separate but related effort to the name standardization.
Commonly used infrastructure-as-code tools do not provide a way to use discoverability
features to express something like "I want a flavor with 2 vCPUs, 8GiB of RAM, a local
20GB SSD disk and Infiniband support but I don't care whether it's AMD or intel" in a
reasonable manner. Using flavor names to express this will thus continue to be useful
and we don't expect the need for standardization of flavor names to go away until
the commonly used IaC tools work on a higher abstraction layer than they currently do.

## Design Considerations

### Type of information included

From discussions of our operators with their customers we learned that
the following characteristics are important in a flavor description:

| Type              | Description                                            |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Generation        | CPU Generation                                         |
| Number of CPU     | Number of vCPUs - suffixed by L,V,T,C (see below)      |
| Amount of RAM     | Amount of memory available for the VM                  |
| Performance Class | Ability to label high-performance CPUs, disks, network |
| CPU Type          | X86-intel, X86-amd, ARM, RISC-V, Generic               |
| "bms"             | Bare Metal System (no virtualization/hypervisor)       |

This list is likely not comprehensive and will grow over time.

Rather than using random names `s5a.medium` and assigning a discrete set of properties
to them, we wanted to come up with a scheme that allows to systematically derive
names from properties and vice versa. The scheme allows for short names (by not
encoding all details) as well as very detailed longer names.

## Complete Proposal for systematic flavor naming

| Prefix | CPU | Suffix       | RAM[GiB]   | optional: Disk[GB] | optional: Disk type | optional: extra features                            |
| ------ | --- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `SCS-` | `N` | `L/V/T/C[i]` | `-N[u][o]` | `[-[Mx]N]`         | `[n/s/l/p]`         | `[_hyp][_hwv][_[arch[N][h][_[G/g]X[N][-M[h]]][_ib]` |

(Note that `N` and `M` are placeholders for numbers here).

Note that all letters are case-sensitive.
In case you wonder: Feature indicators are capitalized, modifiers are lower case.
(An exception is the uppercase -G for a pass-through GPU vs. lowercase -g for vGPU.)

## Proposal Details

### [REQUIRED] CPU Suffixes

| Suffix | Meaning                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| C      | dedicated Core                |
| T      | dedicated Thread (SMT)        |
| V      | vCPU (oversubscribed)         |
| L      | vCPU (heavily oversubscribed) |

#### Baseline

Note that vCPU oversubscription for a `V` vCPU should be implemented such, that we
can guarantee _at least 20% of a core in >99% of the time_; this can be achieved by
limiting vCPU oversubscription to 5x per core (or 3x per thread when SMT/HT is enabled)
or by more advanced workload management logic. Otherwise `L` (low performance) instead
of `V` must be used. The >99% is measured over a month (1% is 7.2h/month).

Note that CPUs should use latest microcode to protect against CPU vulnerabilities (Spectre, Meltdown, L1TF, etc.).
Microcode must be updated within less than a month of a new release; for CVSS scores above 8,
providers should do it in less than a week.
The provider should enable at least all mitigations that are enabled by default in the Linux kernel and the
KVM hypervisor. CPUs that are susceptible to L1TF (intel x86 pre Cascade Lake) should switch off hyperthreading
OR (in the future) use core scheduling implementations that are deemed to be secure by the SCS security team.

If microcode updates needed for mitigation are lacking for longer than a month, default kernel/hypervisor
mitigations are disabled or hyperthreading is enabled despite the CPU being susceptible to L1TF, the
flavors must declare themselves insecure with the `i` suffix (see below).

#### Higher oversubscription

Must be indicated with a `L` vCPU type (low performance for > 5x/core or > 3x/thread oversubscription and
the lack of workload management that would prevent worst case performance <20% in more than 7.2h per month).

#### Insufficient microcode

Not using these mitigations must be indicated by an additional `i` suffix for insecure
(weak protection against CPU vulns through insufficient microcode, lack of disabled hyperthreading
on L1TF susceptible CPUs w/o effective core scheduling or disabled protections on the host/hypervisor).

#### Examples

- SCS-**2C**-4-10n
- SCS-**2T**-4-10n
- SCS-**2V**-4-10n
- SCS-**2L**-4-10n
- SCS-**2Li**-4-10n
- ~~SCS-**2**-\*\*4-10n~~ <- CPU suffix missing
- ~~SCS-**2iT**-4-10n~~ <- This order is forbidden

### [REQUIRED] Memory

#### Baseline

Cloud providers should use ECC memory.
Memory oversubscription should not be used.
It is allowed to specify half GiBs (e.g. 3.5), though this is should not be done for larger memory sizes (>= 10GiB).

#### No ECC

If no ECC is used, the `u` suffix must indicate this.

#### Enabled Oversubscription

If memory is oversubscribed, you must expose this with the `o` suffix.

#### Examples

- SCS-2C-**4**-10n
- SCS-2C-**3.5**-10n
- SCS-2C-**4u**-10n
- SCS-2C-**4o**-10n
- SCS-2C-**4uo**-10n
- ~~SCS-2C-**4ou**-10n~~ <- This order is forbidden

### [OPTIONAL] Disk sizes and types

Disk sizes (in GB) should use sizes 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000.

| Disk type | Meaning                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| n         | Network shared storage (ceph/cinder) |
| h         | Local disk (HDD: SATA/SAS class)     |
| s         | Local SSD disk                       |
| p         | Local high-perf NVMe                 |

#### Baseline

Note that disk type might be omitted â€” the user then can not take any assumptions
on what storage is provided for the root disk (that the image gets provisioned to).

It does make sense for `n` to be requested explicitly to allow for smooth live migration.
`h` typically provides latency advantages vs `n` (but not necessarily bandwidth and
also is more likely to fail), `s` and `p` are for applications that need low
latency (high IOPS) and bandwidth disk I/O. `n` storage is expected to survive
single-disk and single-node failure.

If the disk size is left out, the cloud is expected to allocate a disk (network or local)
that is large enough to fit the root file system (`min_disk` in image). This automatic
allocation is indicated with `-` without a disk size.
If the `-` is left out completely, the user must create a boot volume manually and
tell the instance to boot from it or use the
[`block_device_mapping_v2`](https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded=create-server-detail#create-server)
mechanism explicitly to create the boot volume from an image.

#### Multi-provisioned Disk

The disk size can be prefixed with `Mx prefix`, where M is an integer specifying that the disk
is provisioned M times. Multiple disks provided this way should be independent storage media,
so users can expect some level of parallelism and independence.

#### Examples

- SCS-2C-4-**10n**
- SCS-2C-4-**10s**
- SCS-2C-4-**10s**\_bms_z3
- SCS-2C-4-**3x10s** <- Cloud creates three 10GB SSDs
- SCS-2C-4-**3x10s**\_bms_z3
- SCS-2C-4-**10** <- Cloud decides disk type
- SCS-2C-4-**10**\_bms_z3
- SCS-2C-4-**n** <- Cloud decides disk size (min_disk from image or larger)
- SCS-2C-4-**n**\_bms_3
- SCS-2C-4- <- Cloud decides disk type and size
- SCS-2C-4-\_bms_z3
- SCS-2C-4-\_bms_z3h_GNa-64_ib
- SCS-2C-4-\_ib
- SCS-2C-4 <- You need to specify a boot volume yourself (boot from volume, or use `block_device_mapping_v2`)
- SCS-2C-4_bms_z3
- SCS-2C-4-3x- <- Cloud decides disk type and size and creates three of them (FIXME: Is this useful?)
- SCS-2C-4-3xs <- Cloud decides size and creates three local SSD volumes (FIXME: useful?)
- SCS-2C-4-3x10 <- Cloud decides type and creates three 10GB volumes
- ~~SCS-2C-4-**1.5n**~~ <- You must not specify disk sizes which are not in full GiBs

### [OPTIONAL] Hypervisor

The _default Hypervisor_ is assumed to be `KVM`. Clouds, that offer different hypervisors
or Bare Metal Systems should indicate the Hypervisor according to the following table:

| hyp | Meaning           |
| --- | ----------------- |
| kvm | KVM               |
| xen | Xen               |
| vmw | VMware            |
| hyv | Hyper-V           |
| bms | Bare Metal System |

#### Examples

- SCS-2C-4-10n
- SCS-2C-4-10n\_**bms**
- SCS-2C-4-10n\_**bms**\_z3h

### [OPTIONAL] Hardware virtualization / Nested virtualization

If the instances that are created with this flavor support hardware-accelerated
virtualization, this can be reflected with the `_hwv` flag (after the optional
Hypervisor flag). On x86, this means that in the instance, the CPU flag vmx (intel)
or svm (AMD) is available. This will be the case on Bare Metal flavors on almost
all non-ancient x86 CPUs or if your virtualization hypervisor is configured to
support nested virtualization.
Flavors without the `_hwv` flag may or may not support hardware virtualization (as we
recommend enabling nesting, but don't require flavor names to reflect all
capabilities. Flavors may over-deliver ...)

#### Examples

- SCS-2C-4-10 <- may or may not support HW virtualization in VMs
- SCS-2C-4-10_kvm_**hwv**
- SCS-2C-4-10\_**hwv** <- not recommended, but allowed
- ~~SCS-2C-4-10\_**hwv**\_xen~~ <- illegal, wrong ordering

### [OPTIONAL] CPU Architecture Details

Arch details provide more details on the specific CPU:

- Vendor
- Generation
- Frequency

#### Generation and Vendor

The generations are vendor specific and can be left out.
Not specifying arch means that we have a generic CPU (**x86-64**).

| Generation | i (Intel x86-64) | z (AMD x86-64) | Â a (AArch64)       | r (RISC-V) |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| 0          | pre Skylake      | pre Zen        | pre Cortex A76     | TBD        |
| 1          | Skylake          | Zen-1 (Naples) | A76/NeoN1 class    | TBD        |
| 2          | Cascade Lake     | Zen-2 (Rome)   | A78/x1/NeoV1 class | TBD        |
| 3          | Ice Lake         | Zen-3 (Milan)  | A71x/NeoN2 (ARMv9) | TBD        |
| 4          | Sapphire Rapids  | Zen-4 (Genoa)  |                    | TBD        |

It is recommended to leave out the `0` when specifying the old generation; this will
help the parser tool, which assumes 0 for an unspecified value and does leave it
out when generating the name for comparison. In other words: 0 has a meaning of
"rather old or unspecified".

#### Frequency Suffixes

| Suffix | Meaning           |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| h      | >2.75GHz all-core |
| hh     | >3.25GHz all-core |
| hhh    | >3.75GHz all-core |

#### Examples

- SCS-2C-4-10n
- SCS-2C-4-10n\_**z**
- SCS-2C-4-10n\_**z3**
- SCS-2C-4-10n\_**z3h**
- SCS-2C-4-10n\_**z3hh**
- SCS-2C-4-10n_bms_**z**
- SCS-2C-4-10n_bms_**z3**
- SCS-2C-4-10n_bms_**z3**
- SCS-2C-4-10n_bms_**z3h**
- SCS-2C-4-10n_bms_**z3hh**

### [OPTIONAL] Extra features

Note that these are optional â€” it is recommended for providers to encode this information
into the flavor name, so there is a systematic way of differentiating flavors.
Providers could leave it out however, leaving it to `extra_specs` to make these flavor
capabilities discoverable. Nothing prevents providers from registering the same flavor
under a secondary (or tertiary) name.

`_GX[N][-M[h]]` indicates a Pass-Through GPU from vendor X of gen N with M compute units / SMs / EUs exposed.
`_gX[N][-M[h]]` indicates a vGPU from vendor X of gen N with M compute units / SMs / EUs assigned.

Note that the vendor letter is mandatory, generation and compute units are optional.

| GPU | Vendor |
| --- | ------ |
| N   | nVidia |
| A   | AMD    |
| I   | Intel  |

Generations could be nVidia (f=Fermi, k=Kepler, m=Maxwell, p=Pascal, v=Volta, t=turing, a=Ampere, l=Ada Lovelace, ...),
AMD (GCN-x=0.x, RDNA1=1, RDNA2=2, RDNA3=3), intel (Gen9=0.9, Xe(12.1)=1, ...), ...
(Note: This may need further work to properly reflect what's out there.)

The optional `h` suffix to the compute unit count indicates high-performance (e.g. high freq or special
high bandwidth gfx memory such as HBM);
`h` can be duplicated for even higher performance.

`_ib` indicates Infiniband networking.

More extensions will be forthcoming.

Extensions need to be specified in the above mentioned order.

## Proposal Examples

| Example                   | Decoding                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SCS-2C-4-10n              | 2 dedicated cores (x86-64), 4GiB RAM, 10GB network disk                                        |
| SCS-8Ti-32-50p_i1         | 8 dedicated hyperthreads (insecure), Skylake, 32GiB RAM, 50GB local NVMe                       |
| SCS-1L-1u-5               | 1 vCPU (heavily oversubscribed), 1GiB Ram (no ECC), 5GB disk (unspecific)                      |
| SCS-16T-64-200s_GNa-64_ib | 16 dedicated threads, 64GiB RAM, 200GB local SSD, Infiniband, 64 Passthrough nVidia Ampere SMs |
| SCS-4C-16-2x200p_a1       | 4 dedicated Arm64 cores (A76 class), 16GiB RAM, 2x200GB local NVMe drives                      |
| SCS-1V-0.5                | 1 vCPU, 0.5GiB RAM, no disk (boot from cinder volume)                                          |

## Standard SCS flavors

These are flavors that must exist on standard SCS clouds (x86-64).

We expect disk sizes to be 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000GB, 2000GB.
We expect a typical CPU:Mem[GiB] ratio of 1:4.

| vCPU:RAM ratio | Mandatory Flavors          |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1:4            | SCS-1V-4, SCS-1V-4-10      |
| 2:8            | SCS-2V-8, SCS-2V-8-20      |
| 4:16           | SCS-4V-16, SCS-4V-16-50    |
| 8:32           | SCS-8V-32, SCS-8V-32-100   |
| 1:2            | SCS-1V-2, SCS-1V-2-5       |
| 2:4            | SCS-2V-4, SCS-2V-4-10      |
| 4:8            | SCS-4V-8, SCS-4V-8-20      |
| 8:16           | SCS-8V-16, SCS-8V-16-50    |
| 16:32          | SCS-16V-32, SCS-16V-32-100 |
| 1:8            | SCS-1V-8, SCS-1V-8-20      |
| 2:16           | SCS-2V-16, SCS-2V-16-50    |
| 4:32           | SCS-4V-32, SCS-4V-32-100   |
| 1:1            | SCS-1L-1, SCS-1L-1-5       |

Note that all vCPUs are oversubscribed â€” the smallest `1L-1` flavor allows
for heavy oversubscription (note the `L`), and thus can be offered very
cheaply â€” imagine jump hosts ...
Disks types are not specified (and expected to be n or h typically).

The design allows for small clouds (with CPUs with 16 Threads, 64GiB RAM
compute hosts) to offer all flavors.

Note: Compared to previous drafts, we have heavily reduced the variations
on disk sizes â€” this reflects that for the standard networked cinder
disks, you can pass `block_device_mapping_v2` on server (VM) creation to
allocate a boot disk of any size you desire. We have scaled the few
mandatory disk sizes with the amount of RAM. For each flavor there is
also one _without_ a pre-attached disk â€” these are meant to be used
to boot from a volume (either created beforehand or allocated on-the-fly
with `block_device_mapping_v2`, e.g.
`openstack server create --flavor SCS-1V:2 --block-device-mapping sda=IMGUUID:image:12:true`
to create a bootable 12G cinder volume from image `IMGUUID` that gets tied to the VM
instance life cycle.)

## Naming policy compliance

To be certified as an SCS compliant x86-64 IaaS platform, you must offer all standard SCS flavors
according to the previous section. (We may define a mechanism that allows exceptions to be
granted in a way that makes this very transparent and visible to clients.)

You are allowed to understate your performance; you may implement a SCS-1V-1-5 flavor with
a flavor that actually implements SCS-1T-1-5n (i.e. you dedicate a secured hyperthread instead
of high oversubscription) or even SCS-1D-1.5-8s (1 dedicated core, 50% more RAM and a 8GiB SSD).

Flavor names indicating certain capabilities must _at least_ provide these.

We expect all cloud providers to offer the short, less specific flavor names (such as SCS-8V-32-100).
Larger providers that offer more details are expected to still also offer the short variants
for usability and easier portability, even beyond the mandated flavors.

You must be very careful to expose low vCPU guarantees (`L` instead of `V`), insecure
hyperthreading/microcode `i`, non-ECC-RAM `u`, memory oversubscription `o`. Note that omitting these qualifiers is
overstating your security, reliability or performance properties and may be reason for
clients to feel betrayed or claim damages. It might in extreme cases also cause SCS to withdraw certification
along with public statements.

You may offer additional `SCS-` flavors, following the naming scheme and rules outlined here.

You may offer additional flavors, not following above scheme and not starting with `SCS-`

You must not offer flavors with the `SCS-` prefix which do not follow this naming scheme.
You must not extend the SCS naming scheme with your own suffices; you are encouraged however
to suggest extensions that we can discuss and add to the official scheme.

### Naming options advice

Note that we expect most clouds to prefer short flavor names,
not indicating CPU details or hypervisor types. See above list
of standard flavors to get a feeling.

However, more successful providers will often need to differentiate their
offerings in response to customer demand and allow customers to request
flavors with specific detailed properties. The goal of this proposal is to avoid
providers to invent their own names and then refer customers to (currently
incompletely standardized) `extra_specs`
or worse a non-machine-readable service descriptions to find out the details.

So a cloud provider might well evolve from offering `SCS-8T-16-50` to offering
`SCS-8T-16-50n`, `SCS-8T-16-50n_i2` and `SCS-8T-16-50n_a2` to specify that he
is using network disks and offer a choice b/w intel Cascade-Lake and AMD Rome.
We would expect the cloud provider to still offer the generic flavor
`SCS-8C-16-50` and allow the scheduler (placement service) to pick both more
specific types (or just one if e.g. capacity management considerations suggest
so). We would expect providers in such cases to ensure that the price of a requested
flavor does not depend on the scheduler decisions.

We are looking into the [metadefs](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/introduction.html#metadata-definition-metadefs-service)
mechanism and [extra_specs](https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/extra_specs_and_properties.html)
to allow customers to ask for specific flavor properties without the need to
encode all these flavor details into the flavor name, so the optional pieces
may not be needed much. However, there must be a way to request flavor
properties without encoding the need into an image â€” the indirection via
an image is considered broken by the SCS team.

## Validation

There is a script in [`flavor_name_check.py`](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Tests/iaas/flavor-naming/flavor-name-check.py)
which can be used to decode, validate and construct flavor names.
This script must stay in sync with the specification text.

Ensure you have your OpenStack tooling (`python3-openstackclient`, `OS_CLOUD`) setup and call
`tools/flavor-name-check.py -c $(openstack flavor list -f value -c Name)` to get a report
on the flavor list compliance of the cloud environment.

The script `flavor-names-openstack.py` talks to the OpenStack API of the
cloud specified by the `OS_CLOUD` environment and queries properties and checks
the names for standards compliance and completeness w.r.t. the mandatory
flavor list. It goes beyond the above example in checking that the discoverable
features of flavors (vCPUs, RAM, Disk) match what the flavor names claim.

## Previous standard versions

[Version 1 of the standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/blob/main/Drafts/flavor-naming.md)
used a slightly different naming syntax while the logic was exactly the same.
What is a `-` in v2 used to be a `:`; `_` used to be `-`. The reason for
the change was certain Kubernetes tools using the flavor names as labels.
Labels however are subject to stricter naming rules and in particular don't
allow for a `:`. See [PR #190](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/issues/190)
for a discussion.

Version 1 flavor names can be translated to v2 using the following transformation:

```shell
NAMEV2=$(echo "$NAMEV1" | sed -e 's/\-/_/g' -e 's/:/-/g' -e 's/^SCS_/SCS-/')
```

and the way back can be done with

```shell
NAMEV1=$(echo "$NAMEV2" | sed -e 's/\-/:/g' -e 's/_/-/g' -e 's/^SCS:/SCS-/')
```

Considerations for how providers can ensure a smooth transition for their customers
from v1 to v2 are written in a separate document.

For the time being, the validation tools still accept the old names with a warning
(despite the unchanged `SCS-` prefix) unless you pass option `-2` to them. They will
however not count v1 flavors towards fulfilling the needs against the corresponding
v2 mandatory flavor list unless you pass the option `-1`.
In other words: An IaaS infrastructure with the 26
v1 mandatory flavors will produce 26 warnings (for using old flavors) and 26
errors (for missing the 26 mandatory v2 flavors) unless you pass `-1` in which
case no errors and no warnings will be produced. Registering the 26 mandatory
v2 flavor names in addition will result in passing the test with only 26
warnings â€” unless you specify `-2`. If you do and want to pass you'll need
to remove the old v1 names or rename them to no longer start with `SCS-`.

## Beyond SCS

The Gaia-X provider working group which could have created a superseding standard
does no longer exist.

However, we have been reaching out to the OpenStack Public Cloud SIG and the ALASCA
members to seek further alignment.
