## Introduction

The [Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community) provides standards
for a range of cloud infrastructure types as well as a modular open-source
reference implementation.
The project is governed by the _SCS Project Board_.

## Role of the _SCS Project Board_

The role of the _SCS Project Board_ is the overall governance of the SCS Community and Project.
This happens together with the _Forum SCS-Standards_ of the Open Source Business Alliance. To further
underline this alignment, the _Forum SCS-Standards_ is part of the _SCS Project Board_.
The _SCS Project Board_ itself is elected by the _SCS Community_.

### Definitions

#### _SCS Project_

The _SCS Project_ is the Open-Source project that consists of the software, documentation, documents, blog posts as well as the people ("_SCS Community_") working on this.

#### _SCS Community_

The collective of people, companies, and organizations promoting the idea of the _SCS Project_ as well as the people working on the various aspects.

#### _SCS GitHub Organization_

The _SCS GitHub Organization_ is this: [https://github.com/sovereigncloudstack](https://github.com/sovereigncloudstack)

### Roles in the _SCS GitHub Organization_

#### Members

Joining the SCS GitHub Organization as a contributor results in being assigned the **member role** in the organization. Members are contributors or collaborators who:

- Actively contribute to projects within the organization.
- Have repository-specific access based on their contributions.
- Are eligible to vote in elections and nominate candidates for the _SCS Project Board_.
- Must adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

#### Owners

Members of the _SCS Project Board_ are also designated as **owners** of the SCS GitHub organization. Owners have administrative privileges, including:

- Managing organization-level settings.
- Onboarding new members.
- Enforcing compliance with governance and community standards.

This alignment ensures that governance roles in the SCS Project Board directly translate into operational responsibilities within the GitHub organization.

## Joining the SCS GitHub Organization

Since being part of the GitHub organization comes with a set of responsibilities, joining the SCS GitHub Organization can be done by:

- being invited by the _SCS Project Board_
- submitting a request to be onboarded as a member to the _SCS Project Board_
- have existing members of the GitHub organization nominate you

One of these items is sufficient.

Actively contributing to one or several of the projects under the governance of the SCS project board should typically result in a membership. Please be aware of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Election of the _SCS Project Board_

### Term

The _SCS Project Board_ is elected for the term of one year. Elections are done
within the last six weeks of the calendar year.

### Seats on the board

The _SCS Project Board_ contains five seats. One of these seats is filled by
the delegate of the _Forum SCS-Standards_. The other four seats are voted upon.

### Nominations

Every person who is part of the Sovereign Cloud Stack GitHub organization can be
nominated for the board. Likewise, one can nominate oneself.
The nomination is done by adding the person with the following data to the file corresponding to the term in the Community-Governance folder in the [Standards](https://github.com/sovereignCloudStack/standards/) repository. Obviously, the person, that is to be nominated, should be asked before being added to the file.

### Eligible for voting

Every person who is a member of the GitHub organization "Sovereign Cloud Stack" is eligible for voting. In order to be able to vote an onboarding onto the Identity Management of the SCS community needs to happen.

### Electoral management

The voting process is governed by the _Forum SCS-Standards_.
Voting is done using the [Condorcet Internet Voting Service](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu). This is the same system as is [being used by the OpenInfra foundation](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Election_Officiating_Guidelines#Running_the_election_itself).

### Voting period

The voting will be open for a week.

### Announcement

The voting will be announced on the SCS-Members Mailinglist as well as on the [General & Announcements](https://matrix.to/#/#scs-general:matrix.org). Enlisted voters will receive e-mails to the email address used in the SCS community's Identity Management system.

### Mechanisms

Each eligible voter is asked to rank the candidates according to their priorities.
The four favorite choices among all voters will be elected into the _SCS Project Board_.

## Roles in the _SCS Project Board_

Among the elected Project Board a spokesperson is nominated. The spokesperson is
elected by a simple majority vote among the members of the project board. The
spokesperson is elected for the whole term.
