## Introduction

The standard scs-0007 documents what requirements integration partners must fulfill to be eligible
for being certified as SCS Integrators.
This document contains hints how these requirements may be evaluated by the Forum SCS-Standards
auditor and how exceptions will be handled.

### Voting on exceptions

When someone requests approval for a certified SCS integrator that does not meet all requirements,
this can be waived with a qualified vote in the Forum SCS-Standards.
To avoid conflict of interests and social pressure clouding this exception, we envision the
following process:

- The beneficiary party (the integrator in whose favor the exception is requested) should be
  invited to a meeting to explain why they believe that they qualify as a certified SCS
  integrator despite not meeting the normal qualification criteria.
- The forum members may ask the beneficiary clarifying questions that should be answered.
- To ensure an open discussion, the beneficiary should be excluded from the discussions about
  the matter. The same applies if the beneficiary party is a member of the Forum
  SCS-Standards. In that case, the expulsion should not be counted against the required quorum
  to avoid forum members from having a disadvantage. If the excluded party is a voting member,
  they will automatically abstain from the vote.
- Any parties that have significant conflicts of interests are expected to make these
  conflicts transparent and cast abstention votes.

By the time of re-certification, all exceptions from a previous certification should have been
eliminated.
