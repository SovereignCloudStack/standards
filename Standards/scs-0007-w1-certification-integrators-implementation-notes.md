## Introduction
The standard scs-0007 documents what requirements integration partners must
fulfill to be eligible for certifiying SCS Integrators.
This document contains hints how these requirements may be evaluated by the
auditor of Forum SCS-Standards and how to deal with exceptions.

### Voting on exceptions
According to scs-0007, when someone requests approval for an attestation for an
integrator that does not meet all requirements, this can be waived with a
qualified vote in the Forum SCS-Standards. To avoid conflict of interests and
social pressure clouding this exception, we envision the following process:

* The beneficiary party (the integrator in whose favor the exception is requested)
  should be invited to a meeting to explain why (s)he thinkgs that (s)he
  qualifies as certified SCS integrator despite not meeting the normal criteria
  that are used to judge the qualification.
* The Forum members may ask the beneficiary clarifying questions that should
  be answered.
* The beneficiary should subsequently be excluded from the discussions to ensure
  there can be an open discussion. This also applies if the beneficiary party
  is a member of the Forum SCS-Standards. In that case, the expulsion should not be
  counted against the required quorum to avoid forum members from having a disadvantage.
  The excluded party (if a voting member) thus automatically abstains from the vote.
* Any parties that have significant conflicts of interests are expected to make these
  conflicts transparent and cast abstention votes.
