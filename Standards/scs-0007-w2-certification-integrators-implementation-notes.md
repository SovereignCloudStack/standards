## Introduction

The standard scs-0007 documents what requirements integration partners must fulfill to be eligible
for being certified as SCS integrators.
This document contains hints how these requirements may be evaluated by the Forum SCS-Standards
auditor and how the process to get _Incubator_ status will be handled.

### Voting on _Incubator_ status

When someone requests approval for a certification as SCS integrator with _Incubator_ status (criteria are not met yet), this can be waived with a qualified vote in the Forum SCS-Standards.
To avoid conflict of interests and counteract social pressure, we envision the following process:

- The beneficiary party (the implementation partner in whose favor _Incubator_ status is requested)
  should be invited to a meeting to explain why they believe that they qualify as incubator for a
  SCS integrator certification despite not meeting the normal qualification criteria.
- The forum members may ask the beneficiary party clarifying questions that should be answered.
- To ensure an open discussion, the beneficiary party should be excluded from the discussions about
  the matter.
  The same applies if the beneficiary party is a member of the Forum SCS-Standards.
  In that case, the expulsion should not be counted against the required quorum to avoid forum
  members from having a disadvantage.
  If the excluded party is a voting member, they will automatically abstain from the vote.
- Any parties that have significant conflicts of interests are expected to make these
  conflicts transparent and cast abstention votes.

The goal during the period having _Incubator_ status is to work in accordance with the SCS Standards and Mission Statement towards the criteria for the SCS integrator certification.
