## Introduction

Our assumption is that there are use cases, where CSPs would like to be able to
let customers access their SCS based services by identifying themselves with
credentials that are stored and managed external to the CSP's SCS installation.

This is based on the observation that prospective customers of an SCS based CSP
sometimes already come equipped with an IAM solution of their choice, either on
premises or e.g. as an external 3rd party cloud service. To ease onboarding of
customer employees (or e.g. customer contracted 3rd party admin staff) as SCS
users, it would be good to be able to consume these external identities in SCS.

For customers this avoids the neccessity to explicitly maintain an additional
dedicated account in SCS and this also reduces what SCS needs to do with
respect to taking care of persisting user account information.

To put it in other words, in SCS we would like to be able to delegate
authentication to external identity providers and map those users to roles in
SCS that can be used for authorization decisions when users access SCS services.

In addition to user identities there we also see the necessity to support the
use of "machine identites" (aka "workload identities" or "service accounts").
These will probably be SCS-local accounts and have for example the purpose
to grant CaaS workload access to storage resources served by the infrastructure
layer. Exact architectural details for this are still in active discussion,
but it is anticipated that the IdP component should be very useful in
facilitating the integration.

## Motivation for this document

SCS has multiple service layers, like IaaS and CaaS, both of which running their
own technological stack with specific internal models of accounts and
authorization.

One thing these services have in common, is that they are able
to use SSO protocols like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC) on top of it to
delegate authentication. They are service providers (SAML terminology) and can
be relying parties (OIDC terminology) of a protocol compliant identity provider
(IdP).

So the idea is, to run an SSO IdP as part of SCS to provide a dedicated point
of entry for identites, which the SCS service layers can use as a common
interface to consume external user identities.

The purpose of this document is to specify what requirements a specific
technical IdP implementation (i.e. software solution) needs to fulfill
in the context of SCS.

## Design Considerations

As a central service for identity handling, the IdP
service needs to be robust and reliable.

Customers shall be able to access self service, so that
they can make reasonable adjustments e.g. to role mapping.
At the time of writing this document it's still undecided
if SCS has the requirement of a dedicated "self service" service
that serves as a frontend to provision and re-configure
customer specific data, abstracting e.g. from IdP specific
user interface particularities.

Keycloak is currently being deployed as part of the IaaS reference implementation.
Technically this IdP component shall be shifted from the management
plane to be run on the basis of a "minimal" Kubernetes (e.g. K3S),
e.g. to make use of the "self healing" and scaling features achievable
with that.

So one of the considerations is if the solution will work well on a
K8S environment. The instances will need to share configuration
(probably via the shared backend database) as well as session state.
Maybe one is better prepared for horizontal scaling than the other.

### Options considered

#### Keycloak

Keycloak is a commonly used IdP solution implemented in Java.
It is developed as an open source community project.
Red Hat uses it as upstream source for their Red Hat SSO product
and is also listed as sponsor of the project.
Starting with version 17 the default distribution is based on
Quarkus instead of WildFly/JBoss.

The project maintains several means of community contributions
as listed on the [community section](https://www.keycloak.org/community)
of the project website. It uses [Github issues](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues)
to track development.

It offers a REST API for administration and there's a separately maintained
3rd party python module as well as ansible support for it. Both of these are
downstream of Keycloak itself and may thus not always be feature complete and
suffer latency with respect to getting adjusted to upstream changes.

It offers support for commonly used SSO protocols and is "reasonably" fast
in adopting to protocol standard changes and extensions. This has been
observed in the case of logout support (backend and frontend variants) in OIDC.

It offers a concept of "Identity Brokering", where Keycloak is not just IdP
but also "client" to other IdPs. This allows daisy chaining of identity
federation. In this configuration it can work as a point of protocol
transition between different supported SSO protocols (SAML, OAuth 2.0, etc.).

Beyond this capability of using other IdPs as identity sources, it also supports
using classic LDAP based IAM services as backend (OpenLDAP and Active Directory,
e.g.).

Keycloak's implementation makes some design decisions, that are specific
to it and have consequences for clients of the service. E.g. Keycloak
has a concept of management "Realms", which have their own specific
set of HTTP API entrypoints, both for administration as well as for IdP
requests.

Commonly Keycloak realms can be used to map them 1:1 to user domains,
but since Keycloak supports configuring multiple backend IdPs in a
realm to be used for "Identity Brokering", there is always the
possibility to create a kind of "proxy" realm to provide a single
standard set of HTTP API endpoints for SSO clients (service providers)
to avoid the need to frequently extend/reduce client service configuration
whenever a new IdP federation needs to be added to Keycloak to onboard
a new customer. This is relevant for services like OpenStack Keystone,
which currently cannot be easily reconfigured for new SSO endpoints
without restarting the service, making the service unavailable for
a short span of time and increasing risk connected with service restarts.

Since version 17, Keycloak claims that it's capability for
"cloud native" deployments on Kubernetes has improved.

[Keycloak is offering a REST API](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/20.0.1/rest-api/index.html)
for all aspects of its administration interface.

For storage of Keycloak configuration and local user metadata
(e.g. from which external IdP a user account originally came from)
Keycloak supports several SQL backends through JDBC. Thus
it can be hooked up to a Postgres Database or to a
MariaDB/Galera cluster e.g..

As of April 11, 2023, Keycloak joined the CNCF as an incubating project.

#### Zitadel

Zitadel is a newer implementation of an SSO IdP.
It is implemented in Go and under active development and maintained by ZITADEL.

The project is open for community [contributions](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to all parts of the eco system.
Feature requests and bugs being tracked on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/zitadel/projects/2/views/5) for development.
Community questions can be asked in the [public chat](https://zitadel.com/chat) or via [Github Discussions](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/discussions).
ZITADEL offers support for the commonly used authentication and authorization protocols such as OIDC, OAuth2, SAML2.
It is a compliant and certified OpenID Connect provider with support for various Grant Types for both human users and machine users.
Compared to Keycloak SPIs, ZITADEL offers Actions to customize and integrate (eg, calling external APIs, Webhooks, customizing pre-built workflows, customizing tokens)
Actions are executed at runtime and can be maintained independently of platform.
Identity brokering (OIDC, SAML, JWT) can be configured system-wide or for each organization with templates.
Users will be created just in time for audit purposes and linked to the external identity provider.
Users can have multiple identity providers linked to their profile.

It came to attention of the SCS project because it offers a
fresh take of an organization focussed data model, which has
the potential to simplify IdP federation to SCS customer domains
in the following areas:

- For client services (single set of HTTP API endpoints).
- For SCS operators for provisioning customer [organizations](https://zitadel.com/docs/concepts/structure/organizations)
  and robust configuraton by using templated client, role and mapping
  configuration.
- For SCS customers for a robust user experience for self servicing.

The concept for [Delegated Access Management](https://zitadel.com/docs/concepts/structure/organizations)
reduces the management overhead compared to isolated realms.
Projects (Applications + Roles) can be maintained by one organization and delegated to be used by other Organizations.
Managers that receive granted Projects can assign users permissions to use the project.

[Zitadel is offering REST APIs](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/introduction)
for multiple areas of use and configuration.

It recently also added support for the [Device Authorization Grant](https://github.com/zitadel/oidc/issues/141),
which, at time of writing, is a feauture that is relevant
for SCS to be able use OpenStack CLI and APIs with federated
identities ([Device Authorization Grant](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/221)).

Support for consumption of LDAP backends is available since [Zitadel v2.23.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.23.0)
(see [this guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers/ldap)).

ZITADEL supported backend databases are CockroachDB and PostgreSQL.

For [production setups](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/manage/production) it is recommended
to use Kubernetes (or similar like Knative) and CockroachDB.

At time of writing a PoC "spike" is done to assess and verify the hopes
connected with Zitadel in the context of the SCS testbed.

Currently Zitadel is lacking the possibility to easily add custom claims.
It supports `urn:zitadel:iam:user:metadata`, but that is more suitable
towards Kubernetes and cannot be parsed with the OpenStack mapping mechanism.
[There is work going on](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/3997) which
may be suitable to resolve this issue.
An approach based on Zitadel actions is also currently evaluated.
OpenStack currently makes use of custom claims to pass `openstack-default-project`
from the IdP to OpenStack. Combined with federation to external customer managed IdPs
this should allow customers to manage settings like these in their own IAM.

## Open questions

- How would we implement testbed deployment support for Zitadel?
  - e.g. `wsgi-keystone.conf` would need to look different. One template covering both options?
  - e.g. steps like `openstack federation protocol create` would probably be different.
- Should we support both as options?
  - What's the benefit?
  - How would we allow SCS operators to choose?
- Do we need some kind of SWOT analysis to come to a decision?

## Decision

SCS wants to make use of an IdP as part of the reference implementation.
To move forward with topics of configuration and mapping of roles in a
OAuth2 federation scenario as well as questions of token lifecycles etc. across
the federation stack it makes sense to focus on one IdP implementation at a
given time. Both considered options seem to be potentially viable, but ultimately,
a decision should be made, even if there are no strict/strong reasons for
dismissing either option in particular.

The project's current choice is Keycloak for the following reasons:
Keycloak currently supports the OAuth 2.0 grants that SCS wants to make
use of (e.g. Device Authorization Grant). It is the implementation for
which integration is currently documented in OpenStack and implemented
in kolla-ansible. SCS currently deploys Keycloak and the IAM team has
most hands on expecience with it, e.g. when it comes to colletaral questions
like how to make TLS and signing certificates available to the IdP that shall
be used in federation to external domains.
