# Introduction

The [Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community) provides standards for a range of cloud infrastructure types.
It strives for interoperable and sovereign cloud stacks which can be deployed and used by a wide range of organizations and individuals.

With a growing number of documents and certification levels for sovereign cloud stacks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track
of all stable as well as all upcoming standards. This document describes the standard we use to technically describe certification levels and
the mandatory standards therein.

# Motivation

This standard has three main objectives:
- to provide an overview of the mandatory standards for the different SCS certification levels
- to make the lifecycle of certification levels traceable
- to provide a machine-readable document for further processing (e.g. for a compliance tool suite or continuous integration).

## Overview of mandatory SCS standards

Digging through a repository of draft, stable, replaced and rejected standards becomes increasingly challenging with a growing number
documents and decision records. A central document that lists all mandatory standards to aquire a certain certification level can
resolve this issue. It provides clarity for providers as well as users of sovereign cloud stacks and helps to understand the value
proposition of SCS.

## Lifecycle of certification levels

Standards and thereas certifications will evolve over time. To provide transparency and traceability for the lifecycle of SCS certification levels, the history of certification levels is recorded.

## Machine-readability for further processing
