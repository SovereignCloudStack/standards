## Introduction

The old Docs repository had a subdirectory `Design-Docs/` which holds Docs on
Design Considerations, older Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and even
Standards. It also has a `Design-Docs/tools/` subdirectory with conformance
checks and our overall conformance check driver (from PR#182).

## Motivation

This directory structure is confusing in a number of ways:

- The conformance checks are hard to find.
- The mixture of document types requires searching at two or three places.

We want to improve this (while avoiding unnecessary churn).

## Suggested cleanup (step 1)

- Move `Design-Docs/tools/` contents to `Tests/`
  - Also create subdirectories then for layers and test, while the overall
    conformance check tool, certification specs and README remain in `Tests/`.
- Rename `Design-Docs/` to `Drafts/`.
  - Use individual PRs to rewrite existing ADRs and Standards there to conform
    to our standards and move them over to `Standards/`.

Some documents with findings will remain in the `Drafts` directory.
We may want to categorize these and have a folder e.g. for research results.
